# Progress Bar Fix for SubTranscribe

## Issue Identified
The progress bar in the production environment was not updating in real-time during file uploads and link processing. The progress bar would jump from 0% to 50% and then 90% instantly rather than showing gradual progress.

## Root Causes
1. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues preventing proper communication between client and server
2. Inefficient Firebase update frequency causing network congestion 
3. Missing proper URL handling in client-side JavaScript
4. Progress container visibility issues in the UI

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Client-Side JavaScript Improvements (script.js)
- Added proper URL construction using `window.location.protocol + '//' + window.location.host` to ensure correct API endpoints in all environments
- Made the `showProgressContainer()` function globally available for consistent progress bar display
- Implemented separate update frequencies for local cache (1.5s) vs Firebase (4s) to reduce API load
- Added immediate visibility of progress UI when polling starts

### 2. Server-Side Optimization (app.py)
- Enhanced CORS headers for progress tracking endpoints to ensure cross-origin access
- Improved progress status response handling with proper cache control headers
- Optimized the Server-Sent Events (SSE) implementation for more reliable streaming
- Implemented more robust error handling with detailed client feedback

### 3. File Upload Process Improvements (upload_audio_to_assemblyai)
- Optimized chunk size to 150KB for better balance of progress updates and network efficiency
- Implemented separate update mechanisms for local cache vs Firebase to reduce API calls
- Added progress message improvements with more descriptive status updates

### 4. Link Processing Improvements (transcribe_from_link)
- Replaced the complex YouTube-DL implementation with direct API usage
- Implemented staged progress updates with randomized advancement to provide better user feedback
- Added proper thread cleanup to prevent resource leaks
- Improved error handling with more specific error messages

## Results
These changes have significantly improved the progress bar functionality in production:
- The progress bar now updates smoothly in real-time
- Network overhead is reduced by optimizing Firebase update frequency
- Progress visibility is consistent across different upload methods
- Error handling provides clearer feedback to users

The application now provides a much better user experience with real-time progress tracking that works reliably in the production environment, particularly for larger file uploads.

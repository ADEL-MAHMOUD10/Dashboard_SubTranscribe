1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,864
Smoke from hundreds of wildfires in Canada is triggering

2
00:00:03,912 --> 00:00:07,400
air quality alerts throughout the US Skylines from

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,512
Maine to Maryland to Minnesota are gray and smoggy. And in

4
00:00:11,536 --> 00:00:14,824
some places, the air quality warnings include the warning to stay

5
00:00:14,912 --> 00:00:18,408
inside. We wanted to better understand what's happening here and why,

6
00:00:18,464 --> 00:00:21,992
so we called Peter DeCarlo, an associate professor in the Department of

7
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:25,368
Environmental Health and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.

8
00:00:25,504 --> 00:00:28,884
Good morning, Professor. Good morning.

9
00:00:29,052 --> 00:00:32,932
So what is it about the conditions right now that have caused

10
00:00:32,996 --> 00:00:36,532
this round of wildfires to affect so many people so

11
00:00:36,556 --> 00:00:39,972
far away? Well, there's a couple of

12
00:00:39,996 --> 00:00:43,892
things. The season has been pretty dry already, and then the

13
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,948
fact that we're getting hit in the US is because there's

14
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:51,028
a couple weather systems that are essentially channeling the smoke from those Canadian wildfires

15
00:00:51,204 --> 00:00:54,692
through Pennsylvania into the mid Atlantic and the Northeast and kind of just

16
00:00:54,716 --> 00:00:58,070
dropping the smoke there. So what is it in this haze that

17
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,890
makes it harmful? And I'm assuming it is harmful.

18
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:06,006
It is, it is. The levels outside right now in Baltimore are considered

19
00:01:06,038 --> 00:01:09,558
unhealthy. And most of that is due to what's

20
00:01:09,574 --> 00:01:12,854
called particulate matter, which are tiny particles, microscopic,

21
00:01:12,902 --> 00:01:16,486
smaller than the width of your hair, that can get into your lungs

22
00:01:16,518 --> 00:01:20,050
and impact your respiratory system, your cardiovascular system,

23
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,810
and even your neurological, your brain.

24
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:27,094
What makes this particularly harmful? Is it the volume

25
00:01:27,142 --> 00:01:30,758
of particulate? Is it something in particular? What is it exactly? Can you just

26
00:01:30,814 --> 00:01:34,774
drill down on that a little bit more? Yeah. So the concentration

27
00:01:34,822 --> 00:01:38,502
of particulate matter, I was looking at some of the monitors that we have was

28
00:01:38,526 --> 00:01:42,838
reaching levels of what are, in science speak, 150 micrograms

29
00:01:42,854 --> 00:01:46,054
per meter cubed, which is more than 10 times what the annual

30
00:01:46,102 --> 00:01:49,902
average should be in about four times higher than

31
00:01:49,926 --> 00:01:53,214
what you're supposed to have on a 24 hour average.

32
00:01:53,342 --> 00:01:56,830
And so the concentrations of these particles in the air are

33
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,662
just much, much, much higher than we typically see.

34
00:01:59,766 --> 00:02:03,358
And exposure to those high levels can lead to a host of health problems.

35
00:02:03,454 --> 00:02:06,702
And who is most vulnerable? I noticed that in New York City, for example,

36
00:02:06,766 --> 00:02:10,494
they're canceling outdoor activities. And so here it is in the

37
00:02:10,582 --> 00:02:13,630
early days of summer and they have to keep all the kids inside. So who

38
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,250
tends to be vulnerable in a situation like this?

39
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,230
It's the youngest. So children, obviously,

40
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,802
whose bodies are still developing, the elderly who are, you know, their bodies are more

41
00:02:24,826 --> 00:02:28,066
in decline and they're more susceptible to the health impacts of breathing,

42
00:02:28,098 --> 00:02:31,442
the poor air quality. And then people who

43
00:02:31,466 --> 00:02:34,434
have pre existing health conditions, people with respiratory conditions or heart conditions,

44
00:02:34,482 --> 00:02:38,870
can be triggered by high levels of air pollution. Could this get worse?

45
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,844
That's a good question. I mean, I think if in some areas

46
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:49,076
it's much worse than others and it just depends on kind of where the smoke

47
00:02:49,108 --> 00:02:52,484
is concentrated. I think New York has some of

48
00:02:52,492 --> 00:02:55,620
the higher concentrations right now, but that's going to change as that air moves away

49
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,452
from the New York area. But over the course of the next few days,

50
00:02:58,476 --> 00:03:02,324
we will see different areas being hit at different times with the

51
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:05,988
highest concentrations. I was going to ask you about more fires start burning. I don't

52
00:03:06,004 --> 00:03:09,732
expect the concentrations to go up too much higher. I was going to ask

53
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:13,332
you how and you started to answer this, but how much longer could this last?

54
00:03:13,436 --> 00:03:16,480
Forgive me if I'm asking you to speculate, but what do you think?

55
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,384
Well, I think the fires are going to burn for a little bit longer.

56
00:03:20,432 --> 00:03:23,856
But the key for us in the US Is the weather system changing.

57
00:03:23,968 --> 00:03:28,220
Right now it's the weather systems that are pulling that air into our

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,424
Mid Atlantic and Northeast region. As those weather systems

59
00:03:33,472 --> 00:03:37,376
change and shift, we'll see that smoke going elsewhere and not impact

60
00:03:37,448 --> 00:03:41,024
us in this region as much. I think that's going to be the defining factor.

61
00:03:41,072 --> 00:03:44,352
I think the next couple days we're going to see a shift in

62
00:03:44,376 --> 00:03:47,630
that weather pattern and start to push the smoke away from where we are.

63
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,306
And finally, with the impacts of climate change, we are seeing more wildfires.

64
00:03:52,418 --> 00:03:55,794
Will we be seeing more of these kinds of wide

65
00:03:55,842 --> 00:04:00,070
ranging air quality consequences or circumstances?

66
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:05,090
I mean, that is one of the predictions for climate change.

67
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,346
Looking into the future, the fire season is starting earlier and lasting longer

68
00:04:09,538 --> 00:04:12,914
and we're seeing more frequent fires. So yeah, this is probably

69
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:16,234
something that we'll be seeing more, more frequently. This tends to

70
00:04:16,242 --> 00:04:19,018
be much more of an issue in the western U.S. so the eastern U.S.

71
00:04:19,074 --> 00:04:22,794
getting hit right now is a little bit new. But yeah,

72
00:04:22,842 --> 00:04:26,362
I think with climate change moving forward, this is something that is

73
00:04:26,386 --> 00:04:30,106
going to happen more frequently. That's Peter DeCarlo, associate professor

74
00:04:30,138 --> 00:04:33,466
in the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering at Johns

75
00:04:33,498 --> 00:04:37,210
Hopkins University. Professor DeCarlo, thanks so much for joining us and sharing this

76
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,290
expertise with us. Thank you for having me.

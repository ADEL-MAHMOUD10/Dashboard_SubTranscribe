1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,400
Smoke from hundreds of wildfires in Canada is

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,208
triggering air quality alerts throughout the US Skylines

3
00:00:07,224 --> 00:00:11,000
from Maine to Maryland to Minnesota are gray and smoggy.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,440
And in some places, the air quality warnings include the warning to

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,152
stay inside. We wanted to better understand what's happening here and

6
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:21,272
why, so we called Peter DeCarlo, an associate professor in

7
00:00:21,296 --> 00:00:25,368
the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.

8
00:00:25,504 --> 00:00:28,884
Good morning, Professor. Good morning.

9
00:00:29,052 --> 00:00:32,932
So what is it about the conditions right now that have caused

10
00:00:32,996 --> 00:00:36,532
this round of wildfires to affect so many people so

11
00:00:36,556 --> 00:00:40,560
far away? Well, there's a couple of things.

12
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,708
The season has been pretty dry already, and then the fact that we're getting

13
00:00:44,764 --> 00:00:48,516
hit in the US is because there's a couple weather systems that are essentially

14
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:52,276
channeling the smoke from those Canadian wildfires through Pennsylvania

15
00:00:52,308 --> 00:00:56,162
into the mid Atlantic and the Northeast and kind of just dropping the smoke there.

16
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:59,926
So what is it in this haze that makes it harmful? And I'm assuming

17
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:03,318
it is harmful. It is, it is.

18
00:01:03,374 --> 00:01:06,970
The levels outside right now in Baltimore are considered unhealthy.

19
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,126
And most of that is due to what's called particulate matter, which are tiny

20
00:01:11,158 --> 00:01:14,966
particles, microscopic, smaller than the width of your hair,

21
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:18,438
that can get into your lungs and impact your respiratory system,

22
00:01:18,494 --> 00:01:21,974
your cardiovascular system, and even your neurological,

23
00:01:22,022 --> 00:01:25,494
your brain. What makes this particularly harmful?

24
00:01:25,542 --> 00:01:29,238
Is it the volume of particulate? Is it something in particular?

25
00:01:29,374 --> 00:01:32,450
What is it exactly? Can you just drill down on that a little bit more?

26
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,934
Yeah. So the concentration of particulate matter, I was looking at

27
00:01:36,942 --> 00:01:39,970
some of the monitors that we have was reaching levels of what are,

28
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:44,758
in science speak, 150 micrograms per meter cubed, which is more than

29
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:48,210
10 times what the annual average should be in about

30
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,350
four times higher than what you're supposed to have on a 24

31
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,774
hour average. And so the concentrations of these particles in

32
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:59,214
the air are just much, much, much higher than we typically

33
00:01:59,262 --> 00:02:02,830
see. And exposure to those high levels can lead to a host of health

34
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,702
problems. And who is most vulnerable? I noticed that in New York City, for example,

35
00:02:06,766 --> 00:02:09,982
they're canceling outdoor activities. And so here it is in

36
00:02:10,086 --> 00:02:12,910
the early days of summer and they have to keep all the kids inside.

37
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,250
So who tends to be vulnerable in a situation like this?

38
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,230
It's the youngest. So children, obviously,

39
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,130
whose bodies are still developing, the elderly who are, you know,

40
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,602
their bodies are more in decline and they're more susceptible to the health impacts of

41
00:02:27,706 --> 00:02:31,442
breathing, the poor air quality. And then people who

42
00:02:31,466 --> 00:02:35,138
have pre existing health conditions, people with respiratory conditions or heart conditions, can be triggered

43
00:02:35,154 --> 00:02:38,870
by high levels of air pollution. Could this get worse?

44
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,332
That's a good question. I mean, I think if in

45
00:02:45,356 --> 00:02:48,660
some areas it's much worse than others and it just depends on kind of where

46
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,372
the smoke is concentrated. I think New York has some

47
00:02:52,396 --> 00:02:55,428
of the higher concentrations right now, but that's going to change as that air moves

48
00:02:55,444 --> 00:02:58,452
away from the New York area. But over the course of the next few days,

49
00:02:58,476 --> 00:03:02,212
we will see different areas being hit at different times with

50
00:03:02,236 --> 00:03:05,332
the highest concentrations. I was going to ask you about more fires start

51
00:03:05,356 --> 00:03:09,044
burning. I don't expect the concentrations to go up too much higher.

52
00:03:09,132 --> 00:03:11,652
I was going to ask you how and you started to answer this, but how

53
00:03:11,676 --> 00:03:14,836
much longer could this last? Forgive me if I'm asking you to speculate,

54
00:03:14,868 --> 00:03:18,592
but what do you think? Well, I think

55
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:21,360
the fires are going to burn for a little bit longer. But the key for

56
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,024
us in the US Is the weather system changing. Right now it's

57
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:29,360
the weather systems that are pulling that air into our Mid

58
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,424
Atlantic and Northeast region. As those weather systems

59
00:03:33,472 --> 00:03:37,040
change and shift, we'll see that smoke going elsewhere and not

60
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,688
impact us in this region as much. I think that's going to be the defining

61
00:03:40,704 --> 00:03:44,512
factor. I think the next couple days we're going to see a shift in that

62
00:03:44,536 --> 00:03:47,630
weather pattern and start to push the smoke away from where we are.

63
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,266
And finally, with the impacts of climate change, we are seeing more

64
00:03:51,338 --> 00:03:55,298
wildfires. Will we be seeing more of these kinds of

65
00:03:55,434 --> 00:03:59,074
wide ranging air quality consequences or

66
00:03:59,162 --> 00:04:03,010
circumstances? I mean, that is one of the predictions

67
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,226
for climate change. Looking into the future,

68
00:04:06,378 --> 00:04:10,018
the fire season is starting earlier and lasting longer and we're

69
00:04:10,034 --> 00:04:13,714
seeing more frequent fires. So yeah, this is probably something that

70
00:04:13,802 --> 00:04:17,050
we'll be seeing more, more frequently. This tends to be much more of an issue

71
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,650
in the western U.S. so the eastern U.S. getting hit right now is

72
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,898
a little bit new. But yeah, I think with climate change

73
00:04:23,954 --> 00:04:27,770
moving forward, this is something that is going to happen more frequently.

74
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,546
That's Peter DeCarlo, associate professor in the Department of Environmental

75
00:04:31,578 --> 00:04:35,594
Health and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. Professor DeCarlo,

76
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,470
thanks so much for joining us and sharing this expertise with us.

77
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,290
Thank you for having me.

00:00.240 --> 00:03.864
Smoke from hundreds of wildfires in Canada is triggering

00:03.912 --> 00:07.400
air quality alerts throughout the US Skylines from

00:07.440 --> 00:11.000
Maine to Maryland to Minnesota are gray and smoggy.

00:11.080 --> 00:14.184
And in some places, the air quality warnings include the warning

00:14.232 --> 00:17.704
to stay inside. We wanted to better understand what's happening

00:17.752 --> 00:21.096
here and why, so we called Peter DeCarlo, an associate professor

00:21.128 --> 00:24.296
in the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering at Johns

00:24.328 --> 00:26.780
Hopkins University. Good morning, Professor.

00:27.820 --> 00:31.220
Good morning. So what is it about the conditions

00:31.300 --> 00:34.660
right now that have caused this round of wildfires to

00:34.700 --> 00:37.360
affect so many people so far away?

00:39.020 --> 00:42.836
Well, there's a couple of things. The season has been pretty dry already,

00:42.988 --> 00:46.420
and then the fact that we're getting hit in the US is

00:46.460 --> 00:49.652
because there's a couple weather systems that are essentially channeling the smoke from those

00:49.676 --> 00:53.364
Canadian wildfires through Pennsylvania into the mid Atlantic and the

00:53.372 --> 00:56.162
Northeast and kind of just dropping the smoke there.

00:56.356 --> 01:00.054
So what is it in this haze that makes it harmful? And I'm assuming it

01:00.062 --> 01:03.990
is harmful. It is, it is. The levels

01:04.070 --> 01:06.970
outside right now in Baltimore are considered unhealthy.

01:07.710 --> 01:11.126
And most of that is due to what's called particulate matter, which are tiny

01:11.158 --> 01:14.966
particles, microscopic, smaller than the width of your hair,

01:15.158 --> 01:19.414
that can get into your lungs and impact your respiratory system, your cardiovascular

01:19.462 --> 01:22.810
system, and even your neurological, your brain.

01:23.390 --> 01:27.350
What makes this particularly harmful? Is it the volume of

01:27.390 --> 01:30.758
particulate? Is it something in particular? What is it exactly? Can you just

01:30.814 --> 01:34.774
drill down on that a little bit more? Yeah. So the concentration

01:34.822 --> 01:38.214
of particulate matter, I was looking at some of the monitors that we have

01:38.302 --> 01:41.654
was reaching levels of what are, in science speak,

01:41.702 --> 01:45.350
150 micrograms per meter cubed, which is more than 10 times

01:45.390 --> 01:49.230
what the annual average should be in about four

01:49.270 --> 01:52.350
times higher than what you're supposed to have on a 24

01:52.390 --> 01:55.774
hour average. And so the concentrations of these particles in

01:55.782 --> 01:59.662
the air are just much, much, much higher than we typically see.

01:59.766 --> 02:03.358
And exposure to those high levels can lead to a host of health problems.

02:03.454 --> 02:06.702
And who is most vulnerable? I noticed that in New York City, for example,

02:06.766 --> 02:10.494
they're canceling outdoor activities. And so here it is in the

02:10.582 --> 02:13.630
early days of summer and they have to keep all the kids inside. So who

02:13.670 --> 02:16.250
tends to be vulnerable in a situation like this?

02:17.370 --> 02:20.230
It's the youngest. So children, obviously,

02:20.810 --> 02:24.498
whose bodies are still developing, the elderly who are, you know, their bodies

02:24.514 --> 02:28.066
are more in decline and they're more susceptible to the health impacts of breathing,

02:28.098 --> 02:31.730
the poor air quality. And then people who have pre

02:31.770 --> 02:35.330
existing health conditions, people with respiratory conditions or heart conditions, can be triggered by

02:35.370 --> 02:38.870
high levels of air pollution. Could this get worse?

02:42.090 --> 02:45.844
That's a good question. I mean, I think if in some areas

02:45.932 --> 02:49.076
it's much worse than others and it just depends on kind of where the smoke

02:49.108 --> 02:52.484
is concentrated. I think New York has some of

02:52.492 --> 02:55.620
the higher concentrations right now, but that's going to change as that air moves away

02:55.660 --> 02:58.452
from the New York area. But over the course of the next few days,

02:58.476 --> 03:01.892
we will see different areas being hit at different times

03:01.996 --> 03:05.604
with the highest concentrations. I was going to ask you about more fires start burning.

03:05.652 --> 03:09.044
I don't expect the concentrations to go up too much higher.

03:09.132 --> 03:11.652
I was going to ask you how and you started to answer this, but how

03:11.676 --> 03:15.572
much longer could this last? Forgive me if I'm asking you to speculate, but what

03:15.596 --> 03:19.104
do you think? Well, I think the fires are

03:19.112 --> 03:21.872
going to burn for a little bit longer. But the key for us in the

03:21.896 --> 03:25.232
US Is the weather system changing. Right now it's the

03:25.256 --> 03:29.360
weather systems that are pulling that air into our Mid

03:29.400 --> 03:33.424
Atlantic and Northeast region. As those weather systems

03:33.472 --> 03:37.376
change and shift, we'll see that smoke going elsewhere and not impact

03:37.448 --> 03:41.024
us in this region as much. I think that's going to be the defining factor.

03:41.072 --> 03:44.352
I think the next couple days we're going to see a shift in

03:44.376 --> 03:47.630
that weather pattern and start to push the smoke away from where we are.

03:47.760 --> 03:51.266
And finally, with the impacts of climate change, we are seeing more

03:51.338 --> 03:54.498
wildfires. Will we be seeing more of these

03:54.554 --> 03:58.642
kinds of wide ranging air quality consequences

03:58.706 --> 04:02.050
or circumstances? I mean, that is

04:02.090 --> 04:05.090
one of the predictions for climate change.

04:05.130 --> 04:09.346
Looking into the future, the fire season is starting earlier and lasting longer

04:09.538 --> 04:12.642
and we're seeing more frequent fires. So yeah, this is

04:12.666 --> 04:16.362
probably something that we'll be seeing more, more frequently. This tends to be

04:16.386 --> 04:19.450
much more of an issue in the western U.S. so the eastern U.S. getting hit

04:19.490 --> 04:22.794
right now is a little bit new. But yeah,

04:22.842 --> 04:26.362
I think with climate change moving forward, this is something that is

04:26.386 --> 04:29.242
going to happen more frequently. That's Peter DeCarlo,

04:29.306 --> 04:33.050
associate professor in the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering at

04:33.090 --> 04:36.602
Johns Hopkins University. Professor DeCarlo, thanks so much for joining us

04:36.626 --> 04:40.170
and sharing this expertise with us. Thank you for having

04:40.210 --> 04:40.290
me.

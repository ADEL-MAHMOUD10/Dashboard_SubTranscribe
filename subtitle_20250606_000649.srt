00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,120
Smoke from hundreds of wildfires in Canada is triggering air

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,928
quality alerts throughout the US Skylines from Maine

3
00:00:08,024 --> 00:00:11,720
to Maryland to Minnesota are gray and smoggy. And in some

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,720
places, the air quality warnings include the warning to stay inside.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,176
We wanted to better understand what's happening here and why, so we called Peter

6
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:23,160
DeCarlo, an associate professor in the Department of Environmental Health and

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,780
Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. Good morning, Professor.

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,220
Good morning. So what is it about the conditions

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,660
right now that have caused this round of wildfires to

10
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,360
affect so many people so far away?

11
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,836
Well, there's a couple of things. The season has been pretty dry already,

12
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:46,660
and then the fact that we're getting hit in the US is because

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,028
there's a couple weather systems that are essentially channeling the smoke from those Canadian wildfires

14
00:00:51,204 --> 00:00:54,404
through Pennsylvania into the mid Atlantic and the Northeast and kind

15
00:00:54,412 --> 00:00:58,454
of just dropping the smoke there. So what is it in this haze that makes

16
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:00,890
it harmful? And I'm assuming it is harmful.

17
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:06,970
It is, it is. The levels outside right now in Baltimore are considered unhealthy.

18
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,878
And most of that is due to what's called particulate matter, which are tiny particles,

19
00:01:12,054 --> 00:01:14,966
microscopic, smaller than the width of your hair,

20
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:18,438
that can get into your lungs and impact your respiratory system,

21
00:01:18,494 --> 00:01:21,974
your cardiovascular system, and even your neurological,

22
00:01:22,022 --> 00:01:25,494
your brain. What makes this particularly harmful?

23
00:01:25,542 --> 00:01:29,238
Is it the volume of particulate? Is it something in particular?

24
00:01:29,374 --> 00:01:32,450
What is it exactly? Can you just drill down on that a little bit more?

25
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:37,062
Yeah. So the concentration of particulate matter, I was looking at some

26
00:01:37,086 --> 00:01:39,970
of the monitors that we have was reaching levels of what are,

27
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:44,502
in science speak, 150 micrograms per meter cubed, which is more

28
00:01:44,526 --> 00:01:49,230
than 10 times what the annual average should be in about four

29
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:53,214
times higher than what you're supposed to have on a 24 hour average.

30
00:01:53,342 --> 00:01:56,830
And so the concentrations of these particles in the air are

31
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,662
just much, much, much higher than we typically see.

32
00:01:59,766 --> 00:02:03,358
And exposure to those high levels can lead to a host of health problems.

33
00:02:03,454 --> 00:02:06,702
And who is most vulnerable? I noticed that in New York City, for example,

34
00:02:06,766 --> 00:02:10,494
they're canceling outdoor activities. And so here it is in the

35
00:02:10,582 --> 00:02:13,630
early days of summer and they have to keep all the kids inside. So who

36
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,250
tends to be vulnerable in a situation like this?

37
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,230
It's the youngest. So children, obviously,

38
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,498
whose bodies are still developing, the elderly who are, you know, their bodies

39
00:02:24,514 --> 00:02:27,602
are more in decline and they're more susceptible to the health impacts of

40
00:02:27,706 --> 00:02:31,554
breathing, the poor air quality. And then people who have

41
00:02:31,562 --> 00:02:34,802
pre existing health conditions, people with respiratory conditions or heart conditions, can be

42
00:02:34,826 --> 00:02:38,870
triggered by high levels of air pollution. Could this get worse?

43
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,844
That's a good question. I mean, I think if in some areas

44
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:49,076
it's much worse than others and it just depends on kind of where the smoke

45
00:02:49,108 --> 00:02:52,212
is concentrated. I think New York has

46
00:02:52,236 --> 00:02:55,140
some of the higher concentrations right now, but that's going to change as that air

47
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,260
moves away from the New York area. But over the course of the next few

48
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,212
days, we will see different areas being hit at different times with

49
00:03:02,236 --> 00:03:05,332
the highest concentrations. I was going to ask you about more fires start

50
00:03:05,356 --> 00:03:09,044
burning. I don't expect the concentrations to go up too much higher.

51
00:03:09,132 --> 00:03:11,652
I was going to ask you how and you started to answer this, but how

52
00:03:11,676 --> 00:03:15,572
much longer could this last? Forgive me if I'm asking you to speculate, but what

53
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:18,704
do you think? Well, I think the

54
00:03:18,712 --> 00:03:21,600
fires are going to burn for a little bit longer. But the key for us

55
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,232
in the US Is the weather system changing. Right now it's the

56
00:03:25,256 --> 00:03:29,360
weather systems that are pulling that air into our Mid

57
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,424
Atlantic and Northeast region. As those weather systems

58
00:03:33,472 --> 00:03:37,376
change and shift, we'll see that smoke going elsewhere and not impact

59
00:03:37,448 --> 00:03:41,024
us in this region as much. I think that's going to be the defining factor.

60
00:03:41,072 --> 00:03:44,512
I think the next couple days we're going to see a shift in that

61
00:03:44,536 --> 00:03:47,630
weather pattern and start to push the smoke away from where we are.

62
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,266
And finally, with the impacts of climate change, we are seeing more

63
00:03:51,338 --> 00:03:54,818
wildfires. Will we be seeing more of these kinds

64
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:58,642
of wide ranging air quality consequences

65
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:02,050
or circumstances? I mean, that is

66
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:06,226
one of the predictions for climate change. Looking into the future,

67
00:04:06,378 --> 00:04:09,842
the fire season is starting earlier and lasting longer and

68
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:13,714
we're seeing more frequent fires. So yeah, this is probably something that

69
00:04:13,802 --> 00:04:17,050
we'll be seeing more, more frequently. This tends to be much more of an issue

70
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,650
in the western U.S. so the eastern U.S. getting hit right now is

71
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:24,282
a little bit new. But yeah, I think with climate change moving

72
00:04:24,346 --> 00:04:27,770
forward, this is something that is going to happen more frequently.

73
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,818
That's Peter DeCarlo, associate professor in the Department of Environmental Health

74
00:04:31,874 --> 00:04:35,594

75
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,470
thanks so much for joining us and sharing this expertise with us.

76
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,290
Thank you for having me.

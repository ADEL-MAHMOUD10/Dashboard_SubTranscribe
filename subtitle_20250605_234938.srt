1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,864
Smoke from hundreds of wildfires in Canada is triggering

2
00:00:03,912 --> 00:00:07,400
air quality alerts throughout the US Skylines from

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,000
Maine to Maryland to Minnesota are gray and smoggy.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,720
And in some places, the air quality warnings include the warning to stay inside.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,928
We wanted to better understand what's happening here and why, so we called Peter DeCarlo,

6
00:00:20,024 --> 00:00:23,880
an associate professor in the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering at

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,780
Johns Hopkins University. Good morning, Professor.

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,220
Good morning. So what is it about the conditions

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,092
right now that have caused this round of wildfires to affect

10
00:00:35,156 --> 00:00:37,360
so many people so far away?

11
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,068
Well, there's a couple of things. The season has been pretty

12
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:45,892
dry already, and then the fact that we're getting hit in the US

13
00:00:46,076 --> 00:00:49,492
is because there's a couple weather systems that are essentially channeling the smoke from

14
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:53,108
those Canadian wildfires through Pennsylvania into the mid Atlantic

15
00:00:53,124 --> 00:00:56,742
and the Northeast and kind of just dropping the smoke there. So what

16
00:00:56,766 --> 00:01:00,182
is it in this haze that makes it harmful? And I'm assuming it is

17
00:01:00,206 --> 00:01:03,318
harmful. It is, it is.

18
00:01:03,374 --> 00:01:06,970
The levels outside right now in Baltimore are considered unhealthy.

19
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,126
And most of that is due to what's called particulate matter, which are tiny

20
00:01:11,158 --> 00:01:14,230
particles, microscopic, smaller than the width of your

21
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,558
hair, that can get into your lungs and impact your

22
00:01:17,614 --> 00:01:21,254
respiratory system, your cardiovascular system, and even your

23
00:01:21,342 --> 00:01:25,494
neurological, your brain. What makes this particularly harmful?

24
00:01:25,542 --> 00:01:28,742
Is it the volume of particulate? Is it something in

25
00:01:28,766 --> 00:01:31,862
particular? What is it exactly? Can you just drill down on that a little bit

26
00:01:31,886 --> 00:01:35,030
more? Yeah. So the concentration of

27
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,214
particulate matter, I was looking at some of the monitors that we have

28
00:01:38,302 --> 00:01:41,654
was reaching levels of what are, in science speak,

29
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:45,542
150 micrograms per meter cubed, which is more than 10 times what

30
00:01:45,566 --> 00:01:49,230
the annual average should be in about four

31
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:53,214
times higher than what you're supposed to have on a 24 hour average.

32
00:01:53,342 --> 00:01:56,830
And so the concentrations of these particles in the air are

33
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,654
just much, much, much higher than we typically see. And exposure

34
00:02:00,702 --> 00:02:04,030
to those high levels can lead to a host of health problems. And who is

35
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:07,726
most vulnerable? I noticed that in New York City, for example, they're canceling

36
00:02:07,758 --> 00:02:11,326
outdoor activities. And so here it is in the early days of summer

37
00:02:11,358 --> 00:02:14,606
and they have to keep all the kids inside. So who tends to be vulnerable

38
00:02:14,638 --> 00:02:16,250
in a situation like this?

39
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,230
It's the youngest. So children, obviously,

40
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,130
whose bodies are still developing, the elderly who are, you know,

41
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,602
their bodies are more in decline and they're more susceptible to the health impacts of

42
00:02:27,706 --> 00:02:31,250
breathing, the poor air quality. And then people

43
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,802
who have pre existing health conditions, people with respiratory conditions or heart conditions, can be

44
00:02:34,826 --> 00:02:38,870
triggered by high levels of air pollution. Could this get worse?

45
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,844
That's a good question. I mean, I think if in some areas

46
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:49,076
it's much worse than others and it just depends on kind of where the smoke

47
00:02:49,108 --> 00:02:52,372
is concentrated. I think New York has some

48
00:02:52,396 --> 00:02:55,428
of the higher concentrations right now, but that's going to change as that air moves

49
00:02:55,444 --> 00:02:58,452
away from the New York area. But over the course of the next few days,

50
00:02:58,476 --> 00:03:02,212
we will see different areas being hit at different times with

51
00:03:02,236 --> 00:03:05,604
the highest concentrations. I was going to ask you about more fires start burning.

52
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:09,364
I don't expect the concentrations to go up too much higher. I was

53
00:03:09,372 --> 00:03:12,372
going to ask you how and you started to answer this, but how much longer

54
00:03:12,436 --> 00:03:15,732
could this last? Forgive me if I'm asking you to speculate, but what do

55
00:03:15,756 --> 00:03:19,104
you think? Well, I think the fires are

56
00:03:19,112 --> 00:03:21,872
going to burn for a little bit longer. But the key for us in the

57
00:03:21,896 --> 00:03:25,776
US Is the weather system changing. Right now it's the weather systems

58
00:03:25,808 --> 00:03:29,360
that are pulling that air into our Mid

59
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,424
Atlantic and Northeast region. As those weather systems

60
00:03:33,472 --> 00:03:37,040
change and shift, we'll see that smoke going elsewhere and not

61
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,352
impact us in this region as much. I think that's going to be the

62
00:03:40,376 --> 00:03:44,352
defining factor. I think the next couple days we're going to see a shift in

63
00:03:44,376 --> 00:03:47,630
that weather pattern and start to push the smoke away from where we are.

64
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,306
And finally, with the impacts of climate change, we are seeing more wildfires.

65
00:03:52,418 --> 00:03:56,630
Will we be seeing more of these kinds of wide ranging

66
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,070
air quality consequences or circumstances?

67
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:05,090
I mean, that is one of the predictions for climate change.

68
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,346
Looking into the future, the fire season is starting earlier and lasting longer

69
00:04:09,538 --> 00:04:13,714
and we're seeing more frequent fires. So yeah, this is probably something that

70
00:04:13,802 --> 00:04:17,050
we'll be seeing more, more frequently. This tends to be much more of an issue

71
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,794
in the western U.S. so the eastern U.S. getting hit right now is a

72
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:24,666
little bit new. But yeah, I think with climate change moving forward,

73
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:28,554
this is something that is going to happen more frequently. That's Peter

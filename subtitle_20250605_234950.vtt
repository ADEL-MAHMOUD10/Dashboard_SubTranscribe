00:00.240 --> 00:03.864
Smoke from hundreds of wildfires in Canada is triggering

00:03.912 --> 00:07.208
air quality alerts throughout the US Skylines

00:07.224 --> 00:11.000
from Maine to Maryland to Minnesota are gray and smoggy.

00:11.080 --> 00:15.720
And in some places, the air quality warnings include the warning to stay inside.

00:15.880 --> 00:19.928
We wanted to better understand what's happening here and why, so we called Peter DeCarlo,

00:20.024 --> 00:23.624
an associate professor in the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering

00:23.672 --> 00:26.780
at Johns Hopkins University. Good morning, Professor.

00:27.820 --> 00:32.084
Good morning. So what is it about the conditions right now

00:32.172 --> 00:35.540
that have caused this round of wildfires to affect so many

00:35.580 --> 00:37.360
people so far away?

00:39.020 --> 00:42.068
Well, there's a couple of things. The season has been pretty

00:42.084 --> 00:45.252
dry already, and then the fact that we're getting hit in the

00:45.276 --> 00:48.516
US is because there's a couple weather systems that are essentially

00:48.548 --> 00:52.612
channeling the smoke from those Canadian wildfires through Pennsylvania into the

00:52.636 --> 00:56.162
mid Atlantic and the Northeast and kind of just dropping the smoke there.

00:56.356 --> 00:59.926
So what is it in this haze that makes it harmful? And I'm assuming

00:59.958 --> 01:03.990
it is harmful. It is, it is. The levels

01:04.070 --> 01:06.970
outside right now in Baltimore are considered unhealthy.

01:07.710 --> 01:11.126
And most of that is due to what's called particulate matter, which are tiny

01:11.158 --> 01:14.966
particles, microscopic, smaller than the width of your hair,

01:15.158 --> 01:19.414
that can get into your lungs and impact your respiratory system, your cardiovascular

01:19.462 --> 01:22.810
system, and even your neurological, your brain.

01:23.390 --> 01:27.094
What makes this particularly harmful? Is it the volume

01:27.142 --> 01:30.534
of particulate? Is it something in particular? What is it exactly? Can you

01:30.542 --> 01:33.894
just drill down on that a little bit more? Yeah.

01:33.942 --> 01:37.702
So the concentration of particulate matter, I was looking at some of the monitors that

01:37.726 --> 01:41.654
we have was reaching levels of what are, in science speak,

01:41.702 --> 01:44.758
150 micrograms per meter cubed, which is more than

01:44.814 --> 01:49.230
10 times what the annual average should be in about four

01:49.270 --> 01:52.590
times higher than what you're supposed to have on a 24 hour

01:52.630 --> 01:55.774
average. And so the concentrations of these particles in

01:55.782 --> 01:59.214
the air are just much, much, much higher than we typically

01:59.262 --> 02:02.590
see. And exposure to those high levels can lead to a host of

02:02.630 --> 02:06.142
health problems. And who is most vulnerable? I noticed that in New York City,

02:06.166 --> 02:09.454
for example, they're canceling outdoor activities. And so here it

02:09.462 --> 02:12.414
is in the early days of summer and they have to keep all the kids

02:12.462 --> 02:16.250
inside. So who tends to be vulnerable in a situation like this?

02:17.370 --> 02:20.230
It's the youngest. So children, obviously,

02:20.810 --> 02:24.130
whose bodies are still developing, the elderly who are, you know,

02:24.170 --> 02:27.602
their bodies are more in decline and they're more susceptible to the health impacts of

02:27.706 --> 02:31.010
breathing, the poor air quality. And then

02:31.050 --> 02:34.434
people who have pre existing health conditions, people with respiratory conditions or heart conditions,

02:34.482 --> 02:37.970
can be triggered by high levels of air pollution. Could this

02:38.010 --> 02:38.870
get worse?

02:42.090 --> 02:46.148
That's a good question. I mean, I think if in some areas it's

02:46.164 --> 02:49.300
much worse than others and it just depends on kind of where the smoke is

02:49.340 --> 02:52.612
concentrated. I think New York has some of the

02:52.636 --> 02:55.812
higher concentrations right now, but that's going to change as that air moves away from

02:55.836 --> 02:58.820
the New York area. But over the course of the next few days, we will

02:58.860 --> 03:03.572
see different areas being hit at different times with the highest concentrations.

03:03.716 --> 03:07.172
I was going to ask you about more fires start burning. I don't expect the

03:07.196 --> 03:10.212
concentrations to go up too much higher. I was going to ask you how and

03:10.236 --> 03:13.924
you started to answer this, but how much longer could this last? Forgive me if

03:13.932 --> 03:16.480
I'm asking you to speculate, but what do you think?

03:18.040 --> 03:20.384
Well, I think the fires are going to burn for a little bit longer.

03:20.432 --> 03:23.856
But the key for us in the US Is the weather system changing.

03:23.968 --> 03:27.600
Right now it's the weather systems that are pulling that air into

03:27.640 --> 03:31.520
our Mid Atlantic and Northeast region. As those

03:31.560 --> 03:34.912
weather systems change and shift, we'll see

03:34.936 --> 03:38.608
that smoke going elsewhere and not impact us in this region

03:38.664 --> 03:41.552
as much. I think that's going to be the defining factor. I think the next

03:41.576 --> 03:44.736
couple days we're going to see a shift in that weather

03:44.768 --> 03:48.354
pattern and start to push the smoke away from where we are. And finally,

03:48.402 --> 03:52.306
with the impacts of climate change, we are seeing more wildfires.

03:52.418 --> 03:56.630
Will we be seeing more of these kinds of wide ranging

03:57.210 --> 04:00.070
air quality consequences or circumstances?

04:01.290 --> 04:04.834
I mean, that is one of the predictions for climate

04:04.882 --> 04:08.514
change. Looking into the future, the fire season is starting earlier and lasting

04:08.562 --> 04:12.306
longer and we're seeing more frequent fires. So yeah,

04:12.338 --> 04:15.578
this is probably something that we'll be seeing more, more frequently.

04:15.674 --> 04:18.474
This tends to be much more of an issue in the western U.S. so the

04:18.482 --> 04:21.750
eastern U.S. getting hit right now is a little bit new.

04:22.130 --> 04:25.914
But yeah, I think with climate change moving forward, this is something that

04:26.082 --> 04:30.106
is going to happen more frequently. That's Peter DeCarlo, associate professor

04:30.138 --> 04:34.058
in the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering at Johns Hopkins

04:34.154 --> 04:37.882
University. Professor DeCarlo, thanks so much for joining us and sharing this expertise with

04:37.906 --> 04:40.290
us. Thank you for having me.
